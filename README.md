## Arrays and Strings

- **Arrays:** Understand how to declare, initialize, and access elements in arrays.
- **Multidimensional Arrays:** Learn about multidimensional arrays.
- **Strings:** Explore string handling in C++.

## Pointers and References

- **Pointers:** Understand pointers, memory management, and pointer arithmetic.
- **References:** Learn about references and how they differ from pointers.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- **Classes and Objects:** Understand how to define classes and create objects.
- **Encapsulation:** Learn how to encapsulate data and methods within a class.
- **Inheritance:** Understand inheritance and how to create derived classes.
- **Polymorphism:** Explore polymorphic behavior through function overriding and virtual functions.
- **Abstraction:** Learn how to hide implementation details using abstraction.

## Dynamic Memory Allocation

- **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** Learn about dynamic memory allocation using `new` and `delete` operators.
- **Memory Management:** Understand the concept of memory leaks and how to avoid them.

## Standard Template Library (STL)

- **Containers:** Learn about commonly used containers like vectors, lists, queues, and stacks.
- **Algorithms:** Explore algorithms provided by the STL like sorting, searching, and manipulating containers.

## Exception Handling

- **Try-Catch Blocks:** Learn how to handle runtime errors using try, catch, and throw blocks.
- **Exception Safety:** Understand the importance of exception safety.

## File Handling

- **File Streams:** Learn how to read from and write to files using file streams.
- **File Input/Output Operations:** Understand file input/output operations.

## Templates and Generic Programming
